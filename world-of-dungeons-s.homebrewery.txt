___
* **SPECIES** Pick one: *Dwarfs* have +1 HP, but are one step slower than their armor would indicate (no penalty in heavy armor). *Elfs* have -1 Con, but get the Cantrips ability for free.

* DRUIDS get ***Survival*** and pick one ability each from the Priests and Rangers abilities.

* FIGHTERS get ***Athletics***. Choose two special abilities: **Skirmish** (+1 damage and worn armor counts as one type lighter) **Tough** (+1 armor) **Slay** (+2 melee damage), **Hardy** (+6 maximum HP) **Second wind** (use an action to rest, no food/drink required, once per fight)

Choose two special abilities: **Cantrips** (you know and can attempt to manifest Level+Int simple magical powers from this list: Glow, Snap, Chill, Mend, Muffle, Clean, Gust, Heat, Tug, Scribe, Mask, Float, Bind, Soak, Sound. They create fairly limited or subtle effects.) **Telekinesis** (drink Quicksilver to be able to move things you can see with your mind for a short time, as if you was lifting it with a strength equal to your Cha.) **Illusions** (drink Quicksilver to create an illusory image and/or sound somewhere near you. If it is complex, roll Int to attempt to make it believable.) **Telepathy** (drink Quicksilver to be able to hold a short mental conversation with someone you can see or someone you know very well) **Elementalism** (you have power over 1+Int elements: *Earth, Wood, Metal, Fire, Flesh, Water, Air, Desire, Reason*.

#### Rolling the dice
When you attempt something risky or try to avoid a threat (physical or otherwise), roll 2d6 and add one of your attribute scores, based on the action you’re taking. (The DM will tell you some of the possible consequences before you roll, so you can decide if it’s worth the risk or if you want to revise your action.)

A total of 6 or less is a miss; things don’t go well and the risk turns out badly. A total of 7-9 is a partial success; you do it, but there’s some cost, compromise, retribution, harm, etc. A total of 10 or more is a full success; you do it without complications. 

___
* **SKILLS** If you have an applicable skill, add +1 to the roll.
* *Athletics* is used for physical actions such as climbing, jumping, rowing, etc.
* *Awareness* is used to spot things and react quickly.
* *Deception* is used to trick people in social interaction.
* *Decipher* is used to interpret old texts and languages, and solve riddles.
* *Heal* is used to treat wounds, poison and illness.
* *Leadership* is used to charm or intimidate others.
* *Lore* is used to reveal scholarly knowledge.
* *Stealth* is used to hide, sneak and shadow.
* *Survival* is used to navigate, forage and find shelter.

____
**COMBAT** Whatever side initiates combat goes first.

Take turns, one side then the other. Each combatant can move and take an action such as attacking. Attacks do not use the normal dice rolling rules, other actions (and risky movement) do.

When attacking, roll your damage (D6-2 if unarmed) and subtract enemy armor. Target loses the remainder in HP. A roll of 1 is a fumble, apply damage but the DM may also describe some other consequence.

If on a grid, movement is 6 (5 if light armor, 4 if heavy), double if you do not take an action. Otherwise, handle movement abstractly, DM can ask for appropriate tests to get particularily far in one turn.
___
**SWARMS** of unmemorable enemies act as a single entity. They can attack anyone in range once, but only one attack per target. If they lose half their total HP, the rest flee. If their total HP is ten times the sum of their opponents, fighting them normally is impossible.
```

#### For the Dungeon Master
This is adressed to the DM, but players may also read it.

##### Reaching 0 HP
If a character or monsters HP is reduced to 0, they are out of the fight. For monsters and NPCs, choose to have them pass out, die or take a critical injury, as most befits the situation. For Player Characters, have them roll a Con check:
___
* A success means they are reeling. They *can* continue to fight, but if they take any more damage they die. Otherwise, they can fall down, play dead, and flee at the first opportunity.
* A partial success means they pass out. If their friends win they will be fine,  otherwise they are captured or left for dead. 
* On a failure they pass out, *and* suffer a critical injury.

##### Critical hits
If a Player Character or "boss enemy" rolls a 6 for damage in a cinematically significant situation (such as a last desperate strike, the first shot after a heroic speech or an especially well-described attack), you *may* declare that the attack was a critical hit. If you're not sure, roll a D20: On a 20 it was a critical. Critical hits cause a critical injury in addition to damage.

##### Critical injuries
When a character or creature suffers a *critical injury*, roll for the location and severity of the injury.

Some locations have notes on special effects, and lost limbs cannot be restored except by powerful magic . Beyond that, the exact effects are left to the GM and players to reason out, though in general a critically injured limb cannot be used as normal. For instance, a facial injury might prevent eating solid foods.

* **O** Ruptured Organs, internal bleeding, Death in 1d3 minutes unless treated by magic.
* **D** Death in 1d6 rounds
* **X** Instant Death

#### Multi-die attacks and magic
Magical attacks do 2d6+level or 3d6+level damage if they are especially suited to the situation. Other attacks may also have multiple dice. On such an attack, designate a main die (use a different color). That die alone determines fumbles and criticals.

#### General tips

* Let the players describe things. Ask them about their characters homelands, their motivations, why they are on this adventure, *what they are fleeing from...*
* Describe situations and ask "what do you do". Outside combat, bad things rarely happens if they players don't ignore a threat or miss a roll.
* Telegraph your intent and incoming dangers. Make countdowns, like a big die that you keep reducing the number of as you describe the ever-closer footsteps of the guards...
* Enemies are not limited to PC special abilities and could do anything. They have an armor rating of 0-4, depending on what makes sense. Goblin-level threats have D6/D4 HP/damage, Knight level  threats are 2d6/d6 and Demon level threats are 3d6/2d6. Descriptions and special abilities make them interresting.
* If players attemt ~~crazy~~ interresting things in combat, let them roll a test and let the result be significant one way or the other - don't force them to just attack all the time. 
* Not all adversaries can be harmed by just attacking. Sometimes you need to look for (and find a way to exploit) a weak spot.
* Adversaries don’t have to be killed to get their treasure.
* Give out some one-use magic items such as scrolls and potions fairly frequently, but let more powerful items be rare. Almost all magic should have some kind of downside or unpredictability.
* Read the GM chapter from Dungeon World, and other Powerd By The Apocalypse games to understand the main gameplay loop. Note that World of Dungeons S is a hybrid, with more traditional combat but otherwise intended to have PbtA-like gameplay.
* Don't worry *too much* about encumbrance, except for Thieves using the Dodge talent (who really shouln't carry much at all - removing a heavy backpack is an action). Don't begrudge the PCs a mule or cart, or even a bag of holding.
* The game is about money. Wizards, rangers and priests use 10s each time they cast a significant spell, everyone spends 2s each time they want to regain some of their HP, and the main way to get XP is to waste money on training and frivolous pursuits. To reach level 10, a single character needs 165 000 silver. Don't be stingy, give significant rewards and let them find valuable treasure. 
* Think dangerously. Nothing in the game world is sacred. Let things break, towns be sacked and loved characters die, if the player characters cannot prevent it. Give them their chance at vengeance.
* If the characters are being altruistic, taking jobs without pay or refusing rewards, give out out bonus XP comparable to the treasure they *could* have found. If they help a poor farmers clear out some goblins, you might give 200 bonus XP. If they took the job from a noble, the noble would have rewarded them 200s instead. Be clear upfront about the value of a job: "This kind of thing would normally pay xyz silver."
